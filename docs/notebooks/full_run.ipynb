    "## Intro\n",
    "We'll be aggregating a gridded dataset onto a set of shapefiles, using an extra set of weights. Specifically, we'll use:\n",
    "- gridded: month-of-year average temperature projections for the end-of-century from a climate model (CCSM4)\n",
    "- shapefiles: US counties\n",
    "- additional weights: global gridded population density ([GPW](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4), 30 min resolution)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a setup that you may for example use if projecting the impact of temperature on some human variable (temperature vs. mortality, for example) for which you have data at the US county level. Since your mortality data is likely at the county level, you need to aggregate the gridded climate model output data to counties - i.e., what is the average temperature over each county? This code will calculate which pixels overlap each county - and by how much - allowing an area-averaged value for monthly temperature at the county level. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you also care about where people live - so you'd like to additionally weight your temperature estimate by a population density dataset. This code easily allows such additional weights. The resultant output is a value of temperature for each month at each county, averaged by both the overlap of individual pixels and the population density in those pixels. (_NB: GPWv4 just averages a political unit's population over a pixel grid, so it might not be the best product in this particular use case, but is used as a sample here_)\n",

    "## Calculating area weights between a raster grid and polygons\n",
    "First, `xagg` has to figure out how much each pixel overlaps each polygon. This process requires a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Get everything in the right format. \n",
    "    * Gridded data comes in all shapes and sizes. `xagg` is ready to deal with most common grid naming conventions - so no matter if your lat and lon variables are called 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' or 'y' and 'x' or many options in between, as long as they're in xarray Datasets or DataArrays, they'll work. \n",
    "    * Behind the scenes, longitude values are also forced to -180:180 (from 0:360, if applicable), just to make sure everything is operating in the same coordinate system. \n",
    "1. Build polygons for each pixel \n",
    "    * To figure out how much each pixel overlaps each polygon, pixel polygons have to be constructed. If your gridded variable already has \"lat_bnds\" and \"lon_bnds\" (giving the vertices of each pixel) explicitly included in the `xr.Dataset`, then those are used. If none are found, \"lat_bnds\" and \"lon_bnds\" are constructed by assuming the vertices are halfway between the coordinates in degrees. \n",
    "    * If an additional weighting is used, the weighting dataset and your gridded data have to be homogenized at this stage. By default, the weighting dataset is regridded to your gridded data using `xesmf`. Future versions will also allow regridding the gridded data to the weighting dataset here(it's already accounted for in some of the functions, but not all).\n",
    "    * To avoid creating gigantic geodataframes with pixel polygons, the dataset is by default subset to a bounding box around the shapefiles first. In the aggregating code below, this subsetting is taken into account, and the input `ds` into `xa.aggregate` is matched to the original source grid on which the overlaps were calculated. \n",
    "2. Calculate area overlaps between each pixel and each polygon\n",
    "    * Now, the overlap between each pixel and each polygon is calculated. Using `geopandas`' excellent polygon boolean operations and area calculations, the intersection between the raster grid and the polygon is calculated. For each polygon, the coordinates of each pixel that intersects it is saved, as is the relative area of that overlap (as an example, if you had a county the size and shape of one pixel, but located half in one pixel and half in the other pixel, those two pixels would be saved, and their relative area would be 0.5 each). Areas are calculated using the WGS84 geoid. \n",
