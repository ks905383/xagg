xagg
=======================================

A package to aggregate gridded data in :py:mod:`xarray` to polygons in :py:mod:`geopandas` using area-weighting from the relative area overlaps between pixels and polygons.

The simplest code run, involving raster data in an :py:mod:`xarray` :py:class:`Dataset` ``ds`` and polygons in a :py:mod:`geopandas` :py:class:`GeoDataFrame` ``gpd``, is::

 import xagg as xa
    
 # Get overlap between pixels and polygons
 weightmap = xa.pixel_overlaps(ds,gdf)

 # Aggregate data in [ds] onto polygons
 aggregated = xa.aggregate(ds,weightmap)


:py:class:`aggregated` can then be turned into an :py:mod:`xarray` :py:class:`Dataset`, a :py:mod:`geopandas` :py:class:`GeoDataFrame`, or directly exported to a CSV (for use in, e.g., STATA), NetCDF, or Shapefile.
