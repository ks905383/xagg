  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract = {The United States produces 41\% of the world's corn and 38\% of the world's soybeans. These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29{$^\circ$} C for corn, 30{$^\circ$} C for soybeans, and 32{$^\circ$} C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30--46\% before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63--82\% under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

  abstract = {Costing out the effects of climate change Episodes of severe weather in the United States, such as the present abundance of rainfall in California, are brandished as tangible evidence of the future costs of current climate trends. Hsiang et al. collected national data documenting the responses in six economic sectors to short-term weather fluctuations. These data were integrated with probabilistic distributions from a set of global climate models and used to estimate future costs during the remainder of this century across a range of scenarios (see the Perspective by Pizer). In terms of overall effects on gross domestic product, the authors predict negative impacts in the southern United States and positive impacts in some parts of the Pacific Northwest and New England. Science, this issue p. 1362; see also p. 1330 Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors---agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor---increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1{$^\circ$}C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20\% of county income (90\% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). One percent of gross domestic product per degree Celsius is a steep price to pay for climate change.

  abstract = {Uncertainty in climate projections is driven by three components: scenario uncertainty, intermodel uncertainty, and internal variability. Although socioeconomic climate impact studies increasingly take into account the first two components, little attention has been paid to the role of internal variability, although underestimating this uncertainty may lead to underestimating the socioeconomic costs of climate change. Using large ensembles from seven coupled general circulation models with a total of 414 model runs, we partition the climate uncertainty in classic dose--response models relating county-level corn yield, mortality, and per-capita gross domestic product to temperature in the continental United States. The partitioning of uncertainty depends on the time frame of projection, the impact model, and the geographic region. Internal variability represents more than 50\% of the total climate uncertainty in certain projections, including mortality projections for the early 21st century, although its relative influence decreases over time. We recommend including uncertainty due to internal variability for many projections of temperature-driven impacts, including early-century and midcentury projections, projections in regions with high internal variability such as the Upper Midwest United States, and impacts driven by nonlinear relationships.},

We uncover a U-shaped relationship where extre6me cold and hot temperatures increase mortality rates, especially for the elderly. Critically, this relationship is flattened by higher incomes and adaptation to local climate. Using a revealed-preference approach to recover unobserved adaptation costs, we estimate that the mean global increase in mortality risk due to climate change, accounting for adaptation benefits and costs, is valued at roughly 3.2\% of global GDP in 2100 under a high-emissions scenario. Notably, today's cold locations are projected to benefit, while today's poor and hot locations have large projected damages. Finally, our central estimates indicate that the release of an additional ton of CO2 today will cause mortality-related damages of \$36.6 under a high-emissions scenario, with an interquartile range accounting for both econometric and climate uncertainty of [-\$7.8, \$73.0]. These empirically grounded estimates exceed the previous literature's estimates by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and managing groundwater resources is critical for sustaining livelihoods and supporting various human activities, including irrigation and drinking water supply. The most common method of monitoring groundwater is well water level measurements. These records can be difficult to collect and maintain, especially in countries with limited infrastructure and resources. However, long-term data collection is required to characterize and evaluate trends. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that uses data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and downscaling models to generate higher-resolution (1 km) groundwater predictions. The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing users to implement any machine learning model of interest. We selected four models: deep learning model, gradient tree boosting, multi-layer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors regressor. To evaluate the effectiveness of the framework, we offer a case study of Sunflower County, Mississippi, using well data to validate the predictions. Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of groundwater resource management by demonstrating a framework using remote sensing data and machine learning techniques to improve monitoring and management of this critical resource, especially to those who seek a faster way to begin to use these datasets and applications.},

Globally, groundwater reserves have depleted to the extent that well yield have decreased, pumping cost have risen, and land have irreversibly subsided. In Malawi, groundwater quantity is a national problem, specifically in Mzimba district due to severe droughts. In this study, the spatial and temporal trends of groundwater depletion was assessed using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and Land Surface Models (LSM) from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE). The results show that 1. Groundwater storage is depleting at an average rate of-1.0 {\textpm} 0.06 cm yr-1(0.1043 km3yr-1) in the study area with high rate of up to -1.2 cm yr-1(0.12516 km3 yr-1) in the western side and as low as --0.4 cm yr-1(0.04172 km3 yr-1) in the eastern part. 2. Groundwater storage increases from -13 cm in November up to 15 cm between May and April. 3. Drought is the primary cause of such depletion trends with correlation between active evapotranspiration and groundwater depletion, and downward surface shortwave radiation and groundwater depletion, at -0.577 and -0.678 respectively. The results from the study reveals the need for the scientific community and the general public to consider groundwater recharge strategies specifically by mitigating climate change to reduce prolonged droughts. The study suggests the need to establish a stand-alone groundwater assessment and monitoring authority for enhanced conservation efforts of the water resource in the country.},

  abstract = {Climate hazards can cause major disasters when they occur simultaneously as compound hazards. To understand the distribution of climate risk and inform adaptation policies, scientists need to simulate a large number of physically realistic and spatially coherent events. Current methods are limited by computational constraints and the probabilistic spatial distribution of compound events is not given sufficient attention. The bottleneck in current approaches lies in modelling the dependence structure between variables, as inference on parametric models suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are well-suited to such a problem due to their ability to implicitly learn the distribution of data in high-dimensional settings. We employ a GAN to model the dependence structure for daily maximum wind speed, significant wave height, and total precipitation over the Bay of Bengal, combining this with traditional extreme value theory for controlled extrapolation of the tails. Once trained, the model can be used to efficiently generate thousands of realistic compound hazard events, which can inform climate risk assessments for climate adaptation and disaster preparedness. The method developed is flexible and transferable to other multivariate and spatial climate datasets.},

We show that different forecasting horizons require different forecasting strategies. For short to medium-range lead times, post-processing the forecasted extreme precipitation probabilities provides the most informative outputs for end users. For extended-range forecasts though, it is beneficial to use the large-scale weather variability, as depicted based on nine Mediterranean patterns in combination with moisture-related information, to infer reliable information about extreme precipitation.
