# POSSIBLE CHANGE: I'm not quite sure how python deals with memory
# in this case - but [aggregated], which contains [ds] as one of its
# fields (for keeping the right variables / shapes upon export) may
# result in a bloated variable (especially if [ds] is particularly
# large). A fix could be to instead of [ds] replace it with just 
# what it needs; which is the sizes of all the variables, and the
# coordinates. However, in that case, prep_for_nc() and prep_for_csv()
# would have to be modified.
