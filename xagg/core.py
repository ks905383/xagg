    Builds a weightmap out of saved weightmap component

    grid is particularly high resolution). 

    Assumes the files are generated from :py:meth:`wm.to_file()`;

    - `name/name_lat.nc`, `name/name_lon.nc` :

    - `name/name_weights.nc` :
       the additional weights grid, if used (this file is optional; if no file with this name is found, no weights are assumed, and `wm.weights='noweights'`)

    Parameters
    ---------------
    path : :py:class:`str`

def aggregate(ds,wm,impl=None,silent=None):
    """ Aggregate raster variable(s) to polygon(s)
    
    Aggregates (N-D) raster variables in `ds` to the polygons
    in `gfd_out` - in other words, gives the weighted average
    of the values in [ds] based on each pixel's relative area
    overlap with the polygons. 
    
    The values will be additionally weighted if a `weight` was
    inputted into :func:`xagg.core.create_raster_polygons`
    
    The code checks whether the input lat/lon grid in `ds` is 
    equivalent to the linearly indexed grid in `wm`, or 
    if it can be cropped to that grid. 
    
    
    Parameters
    ---------------
    ds : :class:`xarray.Dataset`
        an :class:`xarray.Dataset` containing one or more
        variables with dimensions lat, lon (and possibly
        more). The dataset's geographic grid has to 
        include the lat/lon coordinates used in 
        determining the pixel overlaps in 
        :func:`xagg.core.get_pixel_overlaps` (and saved in 
        ``wm['source_grid']``)
               
    wm : :class:`xagg.classes.weightmap`
        the output to :func:`xagg.core.get_pixel_overlaps`; a 
        :class:`xagg.classes.weightmap` object containing 

        - ``['agg']``
            a dataframe, 
            with one row per polygon, and the columns `pix_idxs`
            and `rel_area`, giving the linear indices and 
            the relative area of each pixel over the polygon,
            respectively 
        - ``['source_grid']``  
            the lat/lon grid on which the aggregating parameters
            were calculated (and on which the linear indices 
            are based)

    impl : :class:str (def: ``'for_loop'``) (set by :py:meth:`xa.set_options`)
        which aggregation calculation method to use, either of: 

        - ``'for_loop'`` 
            default behavior, aggregation loops through
            all polygons in a for loop, requires less memory 
        - ``'dot_product'`` 
            aggregation is calculated using a dot product, 
            requires much more memory (due to broadcasting of
            variables) but may be faster in certain circumstances
