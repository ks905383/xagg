    """ Wrapper function for determining overlaps between grid and polygon
    
    For a geodataframe `gdf_in`, takes an `xarray` structure `ds` (Dataset or 
    DataArray) and for each polygon in `gdf_in` provides a list of pixels 
    given by the `ds` grid which overlap that polygon, in addition to their
    relative area of overlap with the polygon. 
    
    The output is then ready to be fed into :func:`xagg.core.aggregate`, which aggregates
    the variables in `ds` to the polygons in `gdf_in` using area- (and 
    optionally other) weights. 
    
    (NB: the wrapper uses ``subset_bbox = True`` in :func:`xagg.core.create_raster_polygons`)

    Parameters
    ---------------
    ds : :class:`xarray.Dataset`, :class:`xarray.DataArray`
      an xarray Dataset or DataArray containing at least
      grid variables ("lat"/"lon", though several other names
      are supported; see docs for :func:`xagg.aux.fix_ds`) and at least 
      one variable on that grid

    gdf_in : :class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame`
      a geopandas GeoDataFrame containing polygons (and 
      any other fields, for example fields from shapefiles)

    weights : :class:`xarray.DataArray` or ``None``, optional, default = ``None``
      (by default, None) if additional weights are desired,
      (for example, weighting pixels by population in addition
      to by area overlap), `weights` is an :class:`xarray.DataArray`
      containing that information. It does *not* have to 
      be on the same grid as `ds` - grids will be homogonized
      (see below).

    weights_target : :class:`str`, optional
      if 'ds', then weights are regridded to the grid in [ds];
      if 'weights', then the `ds` variables are regridded to
      the grid in 'weights' (LATTER NOT SUPPORTED YET, raises
      a `NotImplementedError`)

    impl : :class:`str`, optional, default = ``'for_loop'``
      (set by :py:meth:`xa.set_options`)
      whether to use the ``'for_loop'`` or ``'dot_product'``
      methods for aggregating; the former uses less memory,
      the latter may be faster in certain circumstances

    silent : :py:class:`bool`, default = `False` (set by :py:meth:`xa.set_options`)
        if True, then no status updates are printed to std out
   
    Returns
    ---------------
    wm_out : :py:class:`dict`
      the output of :func:`xagg.core.get_pixel_overlaps`  which gives the mapping of pixels to polygon aggregation; to be
      input into :func:`xagg.core.aggregate`.
